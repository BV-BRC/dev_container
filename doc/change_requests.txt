------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Once software is placed in a controlled baseline, all changes are tracked. A
distinction must be made for the cause of a change. The change categories are:

Type 0: Critical failures, which are defects that are nearly always fixed 
before any external release. In general, these sorts of changes represent 
showstoppers that have an impact on the usability of the software in its
critical use cases.
 
Type 1: A bug or defect that either does not impair the usefulness of the 
system or can be worked around. Such errors tend to correlate with nuisances
in critical use cases or serious defects in secondary use cases that have a 
low probability of occurrence.

Type 2: A change that is an enhancement rather than a response to a defect.
Its purpose is typically to improve performance, testability, usability, or
some other aspect of quality that represents good value engineering.

Type 3: A change that is necessitated by an update to the requirements. This 
could be new features or capabilities that are outside the scope of the 
current vision and business case.

Type 4: Changes that are not accommodated by the other categories.

FILES AFFECTED	module.Makefile, all current module Makefiles
COMMENT	If approved, the following code would be added to the module.Makefile
and a foreach loop would be run over all module directories appending this code
to the end of the module Makefile. Module owners are responsible for implementing
the targets. Standard implementaiton designs will be provided in the near future.
#
# Distribution Section
#
# This section deals with the packaging of source code into a
# distributable form. This is different from a deployable form
# as our deployments tend to be kbase specific. To create a
# distribution, we have to consider the distribution mechanisms.
# For starters, we will consider cpan style packages for perl
# code, we will consider egg for python, npm for javascript,
# and it is not clear at this time what is right for java.

CHANGE		Copy everything under the module's lib directory to

CHANGE DATE	01/16/2013
FILES AFFECTED	module.Makefile
COMMENT		Add the command cp -r lib $(TARGET)/ to the deploy-libs 
		target. I'm not very happy with this as it has the potential
		to deploy files under the module's lib directory that 
		shouldn't get deployed. For example:

                  ServiceRegistryImpl.pm.bak-2013-01-16-14-17-01
                  ServiceRegistryImpl.pm.bak-2013-01-16-14-18-57

		get copied over and are the product of running the type
		compiler more than once.

CHANGE		Create webroot directory if it doesn't exist in deploy-docs
PURPOSE		To allow make deploy to deploy-docs

CHANGE DATE	01/16/2013
FILES AFFECTED	module.Makefile
COMMENT		Add -mkdir -p $(TARGET)/services/$(SERVICE_NAME)/webroot
		to the deploy-docs target. This command the following behaviour.
		The - tells make to ignore any errors from the mkdir command.
		This is important in the event that the directory already exists.
		The -p flag tells mkdir to create any parent directories as needed.
